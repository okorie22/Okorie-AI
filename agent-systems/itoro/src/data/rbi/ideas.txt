# Timeframe: 1h, ROI: +75% at 30 bars, Stop Loss: -26.5%
# Trailing Stop: Enabled (+5% after +10% gain, offset 10%)
Implement a multi-Supertrend strategy for futures trading using triple confirmation system. Generate 3 Supertrend indicators for buy signals and 3 for sell signals with different multiplier/period combinations. Buy LONG when all 3 buy Supertrends are 'up' (bullish trend confirmation across multiple timeframes). Buy SHORT when all 3 sell Supertrends are 'down' (bearish trend confirmation). Exit LONG when middle sell Supertrend turns 'down'. Exit SHORT when middle buy Supertrend turns 'up'. Use ATR-based Supertrend calculation with configurable multipliers (1-7 range) and periods (7-21 range). Optimal parameters from hyperopt: Buy multipliers [4,7,1], periods [8,9,8]; Sell multipliers [1,3,6], periods [16,18,18]. Position sizing: Dynamic based on volatility, minimum 30 bars warmup data required. Designed for trending markets with 20-40 trades for 5-15% returns. IMPORTANT: Requires volume > 0 for entries, works best in 1h timeframe with strong trends.

Implement a focused candlestick pattern recognition strategy using TA-Lib's 5 most popular patterns: CDLENGULFING (Engulfing), CDLHAMMER (Hammer), CDLDOJI (Doji), CDLMORNINGSTAR (Morning Star), CDLEVENINGSTAR (Evening Star). Calculate these 5 pattern indicators in populate_indicators using self.I() wrapper. Use categorical parameters to select from these 5 patterns. Buy LONG when selected pattern equals target value (-100 for bearish reversal patterns, +100 for bullish patterns). Pattern functions return integers: -100 (strong bearish), 0 (no pattern), 100 (strong bullish). Pattern functions require Open, High, Low, Close arrays in that order. Designed for daily timeframe where patterns show higher reliability. Use position sizing of 1-3% of equity with trailing stops.
