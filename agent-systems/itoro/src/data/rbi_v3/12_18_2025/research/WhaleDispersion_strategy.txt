STRATEGY_NAME: WhaleDispersion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a risk-aversion strategy designed to identify and exit positions in large-cap cryptocurrencies exhibiting high concentration risk among major holders. The core thesis is that when a disproportionate share of a token's supply is controlled by a small group of entities ("whales"), the asset faces elevated risks of coordinated selling (distribution), price manipulation, and reduced decentralization—fundamental red flags for long-term health.

**KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:**
1.  **Primary Metric: Whale Concentration Ratio:** The percentage of the total token supply held by the top 10 non-exchange, non-contract addresses. Data must be sourced from on-chain analytics platforms (e.g., Nansen, Arkham, Etherscan for ERC-20 tokens).
2.  **Market Cap Filter:** The strategy is specifically activated for **Large-Cap Tokens**, typically defined as those within the top 50-100 by market capitalization. This filter ensures the signal is relevant; small-cap tokens often have high concentration by design.
3.  **Threshold Logic:** A single, clear threshold triggers the action.
4.  **Action:** The strategy is purely **defensive**, generating a SELL/EXIT signal. It does not provide buy or entry signals.

**ENTRY/EXIT RULES:**
*   **Entry:** This strategy does not define entry conditions. It is overlaid on an existing portfolio or trading thesis to provide risk management exits.
*   **Exit (SELL Signal):** Trigger an exit from a long position when **BOTH** of the following conditions are met:
    1.  The token is classified as a **Large-Cap Asset** (e.g., market cap > $5B or rank in top 75).
    2.  The **Whale Concentration Ratio** (Top 10 holders' supply %) crosses above the **30% threshold**.
*   **Re-Entry Consideration:** A position should not be re-entered based on this strategy alone. Re-entry would require the concentration to fall significantly below 30% (e.g., to <25%) AND a separate, fundamental or technical thesis for the token's recovery.

**RISK MANAGEMENT:**
*   **Core Function:** This is a **position-sizing and portfolio risk management** tool. The signal should prompt a reduction or full exit of the position, depending on the trader's risk tolerance.
*   **False Signal Mitigation:**
    *   **Exchange Wallet Exclusion:** Ensure data sources exclude known centralized exchange wallets, as these represent pooled user funds, not a single entity's control.
    *   **Contract/DAO Exclusion:** Exclude protocol treasury contracts or DAO-controlled addresses, as these are typically governed by community vote.
    *   **Context is Key:** Consider the nature of the top holders. If they are known, long-term foundational entities (e.g., the founding team, a reputable venture fund with a multi-year vesting schedule), the immediate risk may be lower. However, the 30% threshold serves as a blanket risk rule.
*   **Limitations:** The strategy is reactive and may signal an exit after significant distribution has already begun. It should be combined with price action and volume analysis for optimal timing.

**REQUIRED INDICATORS & DATA SOURCES:**
1.  **On-Chain Analytics Platform API:** To programmatically fetch the "Top Holders" or "Concentration" data for a given token contract address. (Primary Data Source).
2.  **Market Cap Data Feed:** To filter for large-cap tokens. Can be sourced from any major market data provider (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap).
3.  **Price Feed:** For calculating position value and executing the exit order.

**IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC:**
1.  For each token in the watchlist/portfolio, check its market cap classification.
2.  If it qualifies as a large-cap token, query its on-chain whale concentration metric.
3.  If `Whale_Concentration_Ratio > 30%`: Generate a **SELL** signal for 100% of the position or a predefined percentage (e.g., 50-75%).
4.  Log the signal with the timestamp and the exact concentration percentage for review.

This strategy transforms a qualitative governance risk into a quantitative, actionable trading rule, protecting capital from assets vulnerable to coordinated whale activity.
