STRATEGY_NAME: ExtremeRateArbitrage

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy implements a funding rate arbitrage approach that capitalizes on extreme funding rate deviations in perpetual futures markets. The core premise exploits the mean-reverting nature of funding rates, where extreme positive or negative rates create arbitrage opportunities by taking opposite positions to capture the expected rate normalization.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Funding Rate Monitoring: Continuously tracks the funding rate of the target perpetual futures contract
2. Extremity Thresholds: Uses -0.05% as the extreme negative threshold and +0.05% as the extreme positive threshold
3. Dynamic Position Sizing: Adjusts position size based on how far the funding rate deviates from the thresholds
4. Mean Reversion Expectation: Assumes funding rates will revert toward zero or neutral levels over time

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Funding Rate: The actual funding rate percentage (typically 8-hour intervals)
2. Rate Extremity Score: Calculated as |Current Rate| - 0.05% (absolute deviation beyond threshold)

ENTRY RULES:
1. LONG ENTRY (When funding rate < -0.05%):
   - Trigger: Funding rate crosses below -0.05% threshold
   - Position: Long perpetual futures contract
   - Size: Base position × (1 + |Rate - (-0.05%)| × scaling factor)
   - Example: If rate = -0.08%, extremity = 0.03%, position = Base × (1 + 0.03 × scaling)

2. SHORT ENTRY (When funding rate > 0.05%):
   - Trigger: Funding rate crosses above +0.05% threshold
   - Position: Short perpetual futures contract
   - Size: Base position × (1 + |Rate - 0.05%| × scaling factor)
   - Example: If rate = 0.09%, extremity = 0.04%, position = Base × (1 + 0.04 × scaling)

EXIT RULES:
1. PRIMARY EXIT (Rate Normalization):
   - Long positions: Exit when funding rate rises above -0.02% (less negative)
   - Short positions: Exit when funding rate falls below +0.02% (less positive)
   - This captures the majority of the mean reversion move

2. SECONDARY EXIT (Time-based):
   - Maximum holding period: 3 funding periods (24 hours)
   - Exit regardless of rate if position has been held for maximum period

3. EMERGENCY EXIT:
   - Stop-loss: 5% from entry price
   - Funding rate reversal: Exit if rate moves further in wrong direction beyond entry level

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Sizing Formula:
   - Base Position: 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Scaling Factor: 100x (adjustable based on volatility)
   - Maximum Position: 5% of capital (hard cap)

2. Correlation Limits:
   - Maximum concurrent positions: 3 different assets
   - Maximum portfolio exposure: 15% total capital

3. Funding Rate Monitoring:
   - Check rates every 15 minutes
   - Verify rate persistence (require 2 consecutive negative/positive readings)

4. Market Conditions Filter:
   - Avoid trading during extreme volatility (>5% daily move)
   - Skip if open interest shows abnormal patterns
   - Verify liquidity meets minimum requirements

STRATEGY CALIBRATION:
1. Threshold Optimization: Test different threshold levels (-0.03% to -0.08%) based on asset
2. Scaling Factor: Adjust based on historical rate volatility
3. Exit Optimization: Fine-tune exit thresholds based on backtesting results

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. Requires real-time funding rate data from exchange API
2. Must account for funding payment timing (typically every 8 hours)
3. Consider transaction costs and slippage in position sizing
4. Monitor basis risk between perpetual and spot markets
5. Implement circuit breakers for exchange maintenance or system issues

This strategy works best in markets with:
- High liquidity in perpetual contracts
- Predictable funding rate mean reversion patterns
- Low transaction costs
- Stable basis relationships between perpetual and spot markets

The extremity-based position sizing allows the strategy to take larger positions when arbitrage opportunities are more pronounced, while maintaining disciplined risk management through hard position caps and stop-loss mechanisms.
