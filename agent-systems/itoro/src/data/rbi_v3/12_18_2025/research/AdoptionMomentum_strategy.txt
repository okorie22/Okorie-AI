STRATEGY_NAME: AdoptionMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on tracking holder count dynamics as a primary indicator of token adoption and community interest, using specific percentage thresholds to trigger trading decisions.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Holder Count Data: Requires access to real-time or daily updated holder count data for the specific token
2. Percentage Change Calculation: Tracks the percentage change in holder count over a defined period
3. Threshold-Based Triggers: Uses fixed 20% thresholds for both entry and exit signals

ENTRY RULES:
- BUY SIGNAL: When holder count increases by 20% or more from the previous measurement point
- Entry Timing: Enter long position immediately upon detecting the 20%+ holder growth
- Position Size: Full position allocation on signal confirmation
- Confirmation: No additional technical confirmation required - pure holder count signal

EXIT RULES:
- SELL SIGNAL: When holder count decreases by 20% or more from the previous measurement point
- Exit Timing: Exit entire position immediately upon detecting the 20%+ holder decline
- Stop Loss: No traditional stop loss - exit based solely on holder count dynamics
- Profit Taking: No profit targets - hold until holder count decline triggers exit

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Single Position Only: Trade only one position at a time per token
2. No Leverage: Use spot trading only to avoid liquidation risks
3. Portfolio Allocation: Allocate 100% of designated capital to each signal
4. Timeframe Consideration: Holder count data should be measured consistently (daily recommended)
5. Data Reliability: Ensure holder count data source is accurate and timely

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Holder Count Metric: Primary data stream showing total number of token holders
2. Percentage Change Calculator: Calculates % change between current and previous holder counts
3. Threshold Monitor: Continuously monitors for 20% increase/decrease thresholds

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Data Frequency: Daily holder count checks recommended to avoid noise from intraday fluctuations
- Token Selection: Works best with newer tokens where holder count changes are more significant
- Market Conditions: May perform poorly during broad market downturns regardless of holder count
- False Signals: Rapid holder count fluctuations could trigger multiple quick entries/exits
- Complementary Metrics: Consider adding trading volume confirmation to validate holder count signals

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- This strategy requires reliable access to holder count data, which may be available through blockchain explorers or specialized data providers
- The 20% threshold should be optimized based on historical backtesting for specific tokens
- Consider implementing a minimum time between signals to prevent whipsaw trading
- Works best in trending adoption phases rather than sideways market conditions
