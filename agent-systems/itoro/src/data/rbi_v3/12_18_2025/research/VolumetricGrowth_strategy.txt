STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricGrowth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This on-chain activity strategy focuses on identifying and trading based on directional trends in blockchain transaction metrics, specifically targeting periods of accelerating versus decelerating network usage.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. **Primary Indicators**: Transaction Volume (total value transferred) and Transaction Count (number of transactions)
2. **Trend Analysis**: Uses moving averages and momentum indicators to identify GROWING vs. SHRINKING trends
3. **Threshold System**: Implements minimum volume requirements to filter out low-activity periods
4. **Confirmation Mechanism**: Requires both volume AND count to align in trend direction

REQUIRED INDICATORS & SETTINGS:
1. **Transaction Volume MA** (20-period): Smooths volume data
2. **Transaction Count MA** (20-period): Smooths count data  
3. **Volume Momentum Oscillator** (14-period ROC): Measures volume acceleration
4. **Count Momentum Oscillator** (14-period ROC): Measures count acceleration
5. **Volume Threshold**: Minimum average daily volume (configurable per asset)
6. **Count Threshold**: Minimum average daily transaction count (configurable)

ENTRY RULES (BUY SIGNAL):
Trigger when ALL conditions are met:
1. **Volume Trend Growing**: 
   - Current volume > 20-period volume MA
   - Volume momentum oscillator > 0 and rising
   - Volume > minimum threshold (e.g., 50% above 30-day average)

2. **Count Trend Growing**:
   - Current transaction count > 20-period count MA
   - Count momentum oscillator > 0 and rising
   - Count > minimum threshold (e.g., 30% above 30-day average)

3. **Confirmation**:
   - Both volume and count show GROWING trends for at least 2 consecutive periods
   - No divergence between volume and count trends

EXIT RULES (SELL SIGNAL):
Trigger when ANY condition is met:
1. **Volume Trend Shrinking**:
   - Current volume < 20-period volume MA
   - Volume momentum oscillator < 0 and falling
   - Volume drops below 70% of recent peak

2. **Count Trend Shrinking**:
   - Current transaction count < 20-period count MA
   - Count momentum oscillator < 0 and falling
   - Count drops below 70% of recent peak

3. **Divergence Warning**:
   - Volume growing but count shrinking (or vice versa)
   - This suggests weakening trend foundation

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. **Position Sizing**: Scale position based on trend strength (stronger growth = larger position)
2. **Stop Loss**: 
   - 15% below entry if both volume and count turn negative
   - 8% below entry if only one metric turns negative
3. **Take Profit**: 
   - Primary: 25% profit target
   - Trailing: 10% trailing stop after 15% gain
4. **Maximum Exposure**: Never exceed 5% of portfolio in single position

THRESHOLD CALIBRATION:
- **Base Volume Threshold**: 30-day average volume * 1.3
- **Base Count Threshold**: 30-day average count * 1.2
- **Adjustment**: Increase thresholds during high volatility periods
- **Exclusion**: Skip signals if volume/count below 50% of 90-day average

CONFIRMATION ENHANCEMENTS:
1. **Multi-timeframe**: Check 4-hour, daily, and weekly trends align
2. **Network Health**: Monitor active addresses for additional confirmation
3. **Gas Price Correlation**: Ensure gas prices support volume trends (rising volume + stable/rising gas = strong signal)

FILTERING MECHANISMS:
1. **False Signal Filter**: Require 2-period confirmation before entry
2. **Whale Activity Filter**: Check for single large transactions distorting volume
3. **Exchange Flow**: Monitor exchange inflows/outflows for context

This strategy capitalizes on the fundamental premise that sustained growth in both transaction volume AND count indicates genuine network adoption and usage expansion, while declines suggest waning interest or profit-taking phases. The dual-metric approach with minimum thresholds provides robustness against false signals from low-activity periods or manipulated volume spikes.
