STRATEGY_NAME: MultiPatternReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a daily timeframe pattern recognition strategy that combines multiple bullish reversal candlestick patterns for entry signals, with fixed profit/stop exit conditions and comprehensive risk management.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Pattern Recognition: Uses TA-Lib's candlestick pattern detection with three specific bullish reversal patterns:
   - CDLDOJI == 100 (bullish doji pattern)
   - CDLENGULFING == 100 (bullish engulfing pattern)
   - CDLHAMMER == 100 (hammer pattern)
2. Timeframe: Daily (1d) candles only
3. Data Requirements: Minimum 30 days of daily data required for proper pattern recognition

INDICATORS REQUIRED:
1. CDLDOJI - Doji pattern indicator
2. CDLENGULFING - Engulfing pattern indicator  
3. CDLHAMMER - Hammer pattern indicator
All indicators must be calculated using self.I() wrapper with Open, High, Low, Close arrays as inputs.

ENTRY RULES (LONG POSITIONS):
1. Enter long position when ANY of the following conditions is true:
   - CDLDOJI indicator returns exactly 100 (bullish doji)
   - CDLENGULFING indicator returns exactly 100 (bullish engulfing)
   - CDLHAMMER indicator returns exactly 100 (hammer pattern)
2. Pattern functions return: -100 (bearish), 0 (no pattern), 100 (bullish)
3. Only enter on bullish signals (value == 100)

EXIT RULES (PRIMARY - POSITION-BASED):
1. Take Profit: Exit when position profit reaches 5% (self.position.pl_pct >= 0.05)
2. Stop Loss: Exit when position loss reaches 3% (self.position.pl_pct <= -0.03)
3. These exits are checked in populate_exit_trend using self.position.pl_pct

EXIT RULES (SECONDARY - FREQTRADE BUILT-IN):
1. ROI Table (scaling over time):
   - 93.6% at entry (candle 0)
   - 33.2% after 5271 candles
   - 8.6% after 18147 candles
   - 0% after 48152 candles
2. Fixed Stop Loss: -28.8%
3. Trailing Stop: Enabled with:
   - Positive threshold: 3.2% (trailing starts after 3.2% profit)
   - Offset: 8.4% (trails 8.4% below highest price)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Sizing: 2% of equity per trade (fraction = 0.02)
2. Multiple exit layers provide comprehensive risk protection
3. The 3% manual stop loss provides tighter risk control than the 28.8% system stop loss

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. All pattern indicators must be calculated in populate_indicators() using self.I()
2. Pattern recognition functions require Open, High, Low, Close arrays in correct order
3. The multi-pattern approach generates more frequent signals than rare single patterns
4. Exit conditions are checked in populate_exit_trend() using position profit/loss percentage
5. The strategy combines pattern-based entries with percentage-based exits for balanced approach

ADVANTAGES:
1. Multiple pattern recognition increases signal frequency
2. Tight 3% stop loss protects capital on failed patterns
3. 5% profit target captures quick gains from successful patterns
4. Trailing stop and ROI scaling protect profits on extended moves
5. Daily timeframe reduces noise compared to shorter timeframes

LIMITATIONS:
1. Requires minimum 30 days of daily data
2. Candlestick patterns alone may have limited reliability
3. Fixed percentage exits may not adapt to market volatility changes
4. Daily timeframe means slower trade frequency
