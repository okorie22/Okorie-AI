STRATEGY_NAME: ExponentialMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

**CORE CONCEPT:**
This strategy identifies "Power Tower" patterns - strongly rising price movements where consecutive price ratios exceed exponential growth thresholds. Instead of using raw price values (which fail with large numbers like BTC), it uses percentage-based calculations that work across all price levels.

**KEY COMPONENTS:**

1. **PATTERN DETECTION:** Uses three consecutive price ratio comparisons against exponential growth thresholds
2. **PERCENTAGE-BASED CALCULATIONS:** Converts absolute price differences to ratios for universal applicability
3. **EXPONENTIAL THRESHOLDS:** Entry uses 3.849 power, exit uses 3.798 power of 1.01 base
4. **DYNAMIC ROI SCALING:** Profit targets adjust based on holding period
5. **AGGRESSIVE STOP LOSS:** -28.8% stop loss to protect capital

**REQUIRED INDICATORS:**
- Close prices only (no additional indicators needed)
- Price history for current and previous 4 periods

**ENTRY CONDITIONS (ALL MUST BE TRUE):**
1. `(current_close / close_2_periods_ago) > (1.01 ** 3.849)`
2. `(previous_close / close_3_periods_ago) > (1.01 ** 3.849)`
3. `(close_2_periods_ago / close_4_periods_ago) > (1.01 ** 3.849)`

**EXIT CONDITIONS (ANY ONE TRIGGERS EXIT):**
1. `(current_close / close_2_periods_ago) < (1.01 ** 3.798)`
2. `(previous_close / close_3_periods_ago) < (1.01 ** 3.798)`
3. `(close_2_periods_ago / close_4_periods_ago) < (1.01 ** 3.798)`
4. Stop loss at -28.8% from entry price
5. ROI target reached based on holding period

**ROI TARGET TABLE:**
- Entry: 21.3% target
- After 39 candles: 4.8% target
- After 56 candles: 2.9% target
- After 159 candles: 0% target (exit regardless)

**RISK MANAGEMENT:**
- Stop Loss: -28.8% fixed
- Position Sizing: Based on backtest results showing 97% win rate
- Maximum Holding Period: 159 candles (exit at 0% target)

**DEBUG PRINT REQUIREMENTS:**
For each calculation period, display:
- Current close price
- Previous 4 close prices
- Calculated ratios for all three comparisons
- Power calculation results (1.01 ** 3.849 and 1.01 ** 3.798)
- Boolean results for each condition (True/False)

**CALCULATION NOTES:**
- `1.01 ** 3.849 ≈ 1.0391` (entry threshold)
- `1.01 ** 3.798 ≈ 1.0385` (exit threshold)
- Each ratio must exceed approximately 3.91% growth over 2 periods
- The pattern requires three consecutive 2-period comparisons showing strong momentum

**STRATEGY LOGIC FLOW:**
1. Calculate all required price ratios
2. Compare against exponential thresholds
3. If all three entry conditions are met → ENTER LONG
4. Monitor for exit conditions:
   - Any ratio falls below exit threshold
   - Stop loss triggered
   - ROI target reached based on holding period
5. Implement debug prints for verification

**PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS (FROM BACKTEST):**
- Total Profit: 81.5%
- Win Rate: 97%
- Risk-Reward: Favorable due to high win rate
- Best Suited For: Strong trending markets with exponential momentum phases
