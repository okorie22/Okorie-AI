STRATEGY_NAME: PatternSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy implements a focused candlestick pattern recognition system using TA-Lib's five most reliable reversal patterns. The core approach synchronizes pattern detection with position management to capitalize on daily timeframe reliability.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. Pattern Detection: Uses TA-Lib's CDLENGULFING, CDLHAMMER, CDLDOJI, CDLMORNINGSTAR, and CDLEVENINGSTAR functions
2. Timeframe Optimization: Specifically designed for daily (1d) timeframe where candlestick patterns demonstrate higher statistical reliability
3. Categorical Selection: Allows parameter-based selection of which patterns to trade
4. Pattern Interpretation: Patterns return integer values (-100 for bearish reversal, 0 for no pattern, +100 for bullish reversal)

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Open price array
- High price array  
- Low price array
- Close price array
- All five TA-Lib pattern functions must be calculated using self.I() wrapper

ENTRY RULES:
LONG positions triggered when:
1. Selected pattern function returns +100 (bullish reversal signal)
2. For bearish reversal patterns (Evening Star), entry occurs when pattern equals -100 (indicating completion of bearish pattern, suggesting potential bullish reversal)

EXIT RULES:
1. Primary: Trailing stop loss activated after +8.4% gain with +3.2% trailing offset
2. Secondary: Fixed stop loss at -28.8% from entry
3. Exit when opposite pattern signals (bearish patterns for long positions)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Sizing: 1-3% of total equity per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: Strategy shows -28.8% stop loss level
3. Trailing Stop Configuration:
   - Activates after +8.4% unrealized gain
   - Trails at +3.2% offset from highest price
4. Performance Metrics: +93.6% ROI at 0 bars, +33.2% ROI at 5271 bars

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. Pattern functions require OHLC arrays in exact order: Open, High, Low, Close
2. Use categorical parameters to enable/disable specific patterns
3. Daily timeframe is critical - patterns on lower timeframes may have reduced reliability
4. The strategy capitalizes on the high ROI potential (93.6%) while managing risk through strict position sizing and trailing stops

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider adding confirmation from volume indicators
2. Test pattern combinations for improved signal reliability
3. Adjust trailing stop parameters based on market volatility
4. Consider adding time-based exits for patterns that don't trigger trailing stops
