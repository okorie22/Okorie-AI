A 30-minute check interval (from a likely higher default) ensures consistent monitoring of new positions without being overly restrictive, supporting the balanced approach of controlled activity initiation.",

    "reason": "The system has no trading history to learn from. In BALANCED MODE, the copybot can serve as a source of initial, vetted trade ideas. Increasing the check frequency to every 15 minutes (from a potentially higher default) allows the system to more promptly identify and analyze high-confidence trades from successful wallets. This provides a balanced source of external alpha to jumpstart the strategy while maintaining AI confidence filters.",

    "reason": "With zero trades and stale data, the system lacks its own signals. The Copybot agent can serve as an initial source of trade ideas by mirroring successful traders. Increasing the check interval to 60 minutes (from a likely lower default) provides a steady stream of external ideas without overwhelming the system or causing impulsive follows. This is a balanced method to initiate activity while internal data pipelines are being repaired.",
