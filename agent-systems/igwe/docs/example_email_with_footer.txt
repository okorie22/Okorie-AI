Maria —

Curious if you've looked into alternatives to standard retirement plans for business owners.

Most financial_services folks I work with didn't know these existed until recently.

Worth a conversation?

Hey James —

Do you handle your own retirement planning or do you have someone you trust for that?

If you're open, I can share a quick idea that's working for a few business owners I've been talking to.

Worth a 20–30 min call this week?

Hi Sarah,

Working with some technology owners on retirement planning and wanted to see if you'd be open to a brief call.

No pitch, just sharing what's been working. 30 minutes tops.

Interested?

Best regards,
